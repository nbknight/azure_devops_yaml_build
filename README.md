# Advanced Azure DevOps with Pipelines-as-Code


## Introduction

Welcome to our **Advanced Azure DevOps with Pipelines-as-Code** Repository. This Repository was initially created by `Rathish Ravikumar <rathishr@microsoft.com>` and `Heyko Oelrichs <heoelri@microsoft.com>` for an internal training.

This training is all about getting you started with `Pipelines-as-Code` in `Azure DevOps`.
